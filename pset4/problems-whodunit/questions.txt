1.  a header file in C
2.  fixed-width integer types enhance portability of programs
3.  BYTE is 8-bits, DWORD is 32-bits, LONG is 32-bits and WORD is 16-bits
4.  0x4d42
5.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the whole bitmap file, whereas biSize is the size
6.  bitmap is top-down and it's origin is top-left corner
7.  biBitCount
8.  insufficient memory to allocate for pointer
9.  because size of stuct is specified as unit size and a for loop is used to iterate through unit size
10. 3
11. changes the position of pointer by offset bytes from relative position (can be current position, start of file or end of file)
12. current location of file pointer
